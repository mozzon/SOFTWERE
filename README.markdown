# Variable Font Fun (CSS Animation Version)
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/electricgarden/pen/PooLxGJ](https://codepen.io/electricgarden/pen/PooLxGJ).

 Everybody's doing it! (Having fun with variables fonts that is.) I wanted to take them for a test drive myself and added in a bit of rainbow glow while I was at it.

This fork:
This version exclusively uses CSS for the animation. No more requestAnimationFrame loop as in the original. The only JS being used is to split the text into individual characters using the lovely Splitting library.
